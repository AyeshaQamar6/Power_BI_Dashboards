The dataset was about "Diabetes" in women and contains a lot about its terminologies. Here is a brief of what I have done with this dataset and theÂ visuals.
Here I have used a total of 9 visuals in which the first one is of "Slicer" for the outcome where 0 represents that the person isn't diabetic and 1 represents the diabetic one. Then I used 3 card visuals that show the "Sum of Insulin", "Sum of Glucose", and "Sum of Pregnancies" based on the outcome selection. Then I used an "Area Chart" that shows the "Sum of Glucose" and "Sum of Insulin" by "Blood Pressure". The next visual in my dashboard is a "Pie Chart" displaying the ratio between the "Sum of Glucose" and "Sum of Insulin". The "KPI" visual then required a little detail for "Sum of Pregnancies" and "Sum of Insulin" by "Age" where it represents a goal for the direction of fields in good, bad, or neutral terms. The "Clustered Column Chart" having a graph between "Sum of DiabetesPedigreeFunction" and "Age" shows at which age it highly works. The last visual of the "Line Chart" represents the effect of the "Sum of Pregnancies" affected by "Blood Pressure" and to make the visual interesting I used step as the line type, also I enabled markers for detailing.
I really enjoyed making and working with these visuals, and also I got to know about more detailed functions of the visuals by this dataset.
